# Base — Volume Explosion Detector

This doesn't wait for price to move.  
It screams the moment **volume explodes 1000%+ in under 60 seconds** — while the chart is still flat.

Because real pumps don't start with price.  
They start with **volume panic**.

## Run

```bash
python base_volume_explosion.py
